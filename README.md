# Django Work Manager (Full Stack Web Project)

This is a React-Django website featuring user log in, sign up, log out etc. Users can post their To-dos on the website after logging in and click on finish when they are done with it. This is a great place to store your day to day important activities. Also there is an option to delete To-dos incase if you have cancelled your program.

## Description

This is a Full Stack Web Project which is implemented using Django(backend) and React(frontend).

##### For the Backend :-

- Django is used in the backend to manage database, setup models, handle REST API calls.
- Implemented REST API using Django REST Framework. All CRUD operations on To-dos, login, logout, user registrations etc is done using API. Used Django REST Knox for token authentication to securely communicate and exchange data with Django. Read [here](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for more information.
- Access links [here](https://pypi.org/project/django-rest-knox/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31600497/django-drf-token-based-authentication-vs-json-web-token) to see the differences between inbuilt DRF tokens and other auth libraries respectively.

##### For the Frontend :-

- **React** : Popular open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook. Read [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-js-introduction-working/) and [here](https://medium.com/leanjs/introduction-to-react-3000e9cbcd26) for more information.
- **ReactDOM** : ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. Read [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-reactdom/) for more information.
- **Redux** : It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data. Simply put, Redux is a state management tool. Read [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/) and [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/redux-designers-guide/) for more information.
- **Redux Thunk** : Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. Read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43788447/why-use-redux-thunk) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34570758/why-do-we-need-middleware-for-async-flow-in-redux) for more information.
- **Axios** : Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser.
- **Redux DevTools** : Redux DevTools for debugging application's state changes. It's a very important utility tool.
- **React Router** : Declarative routing for React. Read [here](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router#readme) for more information.
- **Babel** : Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones). Read [here](http://nicholasjohnson.com/blog/what-is-babel/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47721169/babel-vs-babel-core-vs-babel-loader-vs-babel-preset-2015-vs-babel-preset-react-v) for more information.
- **Webpack** : Webpack takes all your javascript files and any other assets and transforms then into one huge file (bundles them). Read [here](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/why-webpack/) for more information.
